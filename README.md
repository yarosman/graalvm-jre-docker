# GraalVM JRE docker container

## Whatâ€™s inside

The image is similar to [`openjdk`](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/) except,
of course, this one comes with Graal VM.

## Usage

Since GraalVM's binaries are on the `$PATH`, you can invoke them easily. Or build a
derived image based on this.

```
$ docker pull ghcr.io/yarosman/graalvm-jre-docker
```
